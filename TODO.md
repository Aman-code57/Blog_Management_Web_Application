# TODO for Adding Clickable "Add Blog" Link in Homepage

- [ ] Modify Homepage.jsx to replace static "Add Blog" text with a conditional Link component that navigates to "/create-blog" if authenticated, otherwise to "/login".
- [ ] Test the application to ensure the link navigates correctly in both authenticated and unauthenticated states.
