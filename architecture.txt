The specific architecture name you are following is Three-Tier Architecture (also known as Three-Layer Architecture or Multi-Tier Architecture).

Why this name?
Presentation Tier (Frontend): React SPA handling user interface, routing, and client-side logic
Application Tier (Backend): FastAPI REST API with business logic, API endpoints, authentication, and data processing
Data Tier (Database): SQLAlchemy ORM models and database connection layer
This architecture provides clear separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability by isolating the user interface, application logic, and data storage into distinct layers that communicate through well-defined interfaces (API calls).
